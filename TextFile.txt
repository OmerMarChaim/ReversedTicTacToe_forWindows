We made three delegates raised from the Logic Layer and handled it in the UI layer for updating the display . 
The first is Action delegate that is raised from the Board Class in the Logic and handled at the GameManger class in the UI .
this Delegate sets the point at GameBoardForm form at the exact point.
The Second is Event Handler. We made a new GameOverEventArgs Which is a class that extends from EventArgs and holds the current game Status and the winnerPlayer.
when there is GameOver this EventHandler notify the Lisner at Game Manger at the Ui , which shows the direct message on the Screen .
The third is a delegate that reports for every change in CurrentPlayer and shows it in the UI form.
also we add functionality of the Exit button which implements the Q sign of the UI Of game 2 .
we add Colors to the gameBoardForm while the button is clicked.
